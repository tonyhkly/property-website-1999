# Property Website 1999 Hackathon Project

I took part in a work hackathon project with the aim of creating the tackiest and headache inducing  property website that has ever been made. We created a website with a theme of 1999 so lots of bright colours and gifs are involved. 

The team was made up of 3 engineers and 7 progamming newbies from various parts of the company including Customer Support and Business Analysis.
